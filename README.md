### Combined and Refined Detailed Setup and Usage Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and using the provided Python script to automate interactions with Bot-Hosting.net using hCaptcha

### Prerequisites

1. **Python Installation**:
   - Ensure Python is installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - During installation, make sure you check the option to add Python to your system PATH.

2. **Google Chrome Installation**:
   - Ensure Google Chrome is installed on your machine. You can download it from [google.com/chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

### Step-by-Step Setup Guide

1. **Download the Script**:
   - Save the provided script as `main.py` on your local machine.

2. **Open Command Prompt**:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter to open the Command Prompt.

3. **Navigate to the Script Directory**:
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you saved the `main.py` script. For example:
     ```sh
     cd path\to\your\script\directory
     ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   - In the Command Prompt, run the script by typing:
     ```sh
     python autosetup.py
     ```

### Detailed Usage Guide

1. **Script Execution**:
   - When you run the script, it will first check if the required Python packages (`selenium` and `webdriver-manager`) are installed. If they are not, the script will automatically install them.

2. **Prompt for hCaptcha Accessibility Token**:
   - The script will prompt you to enter your hCaptcha accessibility token:
     ```plaintext
     Please enter your hCaptcha accessibility token:
     ```
   - Enter your token and press Enter.

3. **Browser Automation**:
   - The script will launch Google Chrome with the specified user data directory and user agent.
   - It will navigate to the hCaptcha website to set the accessibility token in the browser's cookies.
   - Then, it will navigate to the target website (`https://bot-hosting.net/panel/earn`).

4. **Automated Captcha Handling**:
   - With a valid hCaptcha accessibility token, the captcha challenges should be automatically solved.
   - The script will check for the presence of a captcha challenge and handle it without requiring manual intervention.

5. **Claiming Coins**:
   - The script will attempt to claim free coins automatically.
   - If successful, it will wait for a specified interval (16 seconds) before attempting again.

6. **Completion**:
   - The script will terminate once it detects that you cannot claim free coins anymore.
   - It will print "Done!" and wait for you to press any key to close the Command Prompt.

### Troubleshooting

1. **Python Not Found**:
   - If you receive an error indicating that Python is not recognized as a command, ensure that Python is installed and added to your system PATH.

2. **Chrome Not Found**:
   - If the script fails to find the Chrome executable, ensure that Google Chrome is installed and that the registry entry exists.

3. **Package Installation Issues**:
   - If the script fails to install the required packages, try installing them manually using pip:
     ```sh
     pip install selenium webdriver-manager
     ```

4. **hCaptcha Accessibility Token Issues**:
   - Ensure you are entering a valid hCaptcha accessibility token. If you encounter issues, verify the token's validity and try again.

5. **General Errors**:
   - If you encounter any other errors, the script will print the error message. Review the message for clues and ensure all prerequisites are met.
